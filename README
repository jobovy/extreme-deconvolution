INSTALLATION:
--------------

(for an alternative way to install the python library, see the
INSTALL_PYTHON file)


The installation can produce two things: (1) a shared library which
can be called from other programs and which is called in the IDL
wrapper provided with the distribution, (2) a "main" program which
runs on input files. See usage below for instructions on how to use these.

The shared library will be installed in the current directory, and the
installation command will also attempt ensure that the path to the
shared library in the IDL wrapper is correct. Please do check this
path in the IDL wrapper if problems occur with the wrapper. If make
install is not called the location of the '.so' should be set manually
in the IDL wrapper (which is located in the /pro directory).

This program needs the Gnu Scientific Library
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). The installation will not succeed
if this library is not found.

Installation:
make
sudo make install
make idlwrapper
make pywrapper
make rpackage
make testidl
make testpy
make clean

1) make: make will create both the shared objected library as well as
the "main" program. Run "make extremedeconvolution" to just compile
the main program, "make extremedeconvolution.so" to just compile the
shared object library. These files will be deposited in the 'build/'
sub-directory.

2) sudo make install: will copy the shared object library to
/usr/local/lib . To install somewhere else run

sudo make install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/install/dir/

make sure to end in '/'.

3) make idlwrapper: will set the path of the shared object library in the
IDL wrapper. If you installed the library by specifying INSTALL_DIR, also run

make idlwrapper INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/install/dir/

4) make pywrapper: will set the path of the shared object library in
the Python wrapper (that this works is not critical if the library is
installed in a standard place). If you installed the library by
specifying INSTALL_DIR, also run

make pywrapper INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/install/dir/

5) make rpackage: will build and install the R package "ExtremeDeconvolution".

6) make testidl: this will run the test program 'fit_tf.pro' from the
examples directory, fitting the Tully-Fisher relation in different
bandpasses (see arXiv:0905:2979v1 for details). A plot TF.ps and
output file TF.tex will be produced in the examples directory. If the
test succeeds 'Ouput of test agrees with given solution' will be
printed. If the test (diff of TF.tex and TF.out) fails 'Output of test
does not agree with given solution Manually diff the TF.tex and TF.out
(given solution) file' will be printed. IMPORTANT: If your IDL
installation is not 'idl', pass the variable IDL=/your/idl/bin

7) make testpy: Tests whether the python program can access the
library and gives the expected output for a test run. Uses python's
doctest module. IMPORTANT: If your Python installation is not
'python', pass the variable PYTHON=/your/python/bin

8) make clean: cleans up intermediate files

9*) make spotless: deletes all the intermediate files as well as the main
program and the shared library.



USAGE I: THROUGH THE PYTHON OR IDL WRAPPERS
--------------------------------------------

Usage through the python or IDL wrappers is encouraged. Indeed, the
"main" program is lacking in many respects, was never used in any
scientific analysis, and has not been tested. However, it might
work. More on this later.

See the python and IDL wrapper header for information on how to call
the IDL routine. Various logfiles can be written, one of them logs
everything (ie, loglikelihoods after each iteration + input and output
parameters). The other one only outputs the loglikelihood trajectory
of the accepted split and merge moves.

The code given here is more general than the algorithm given in the
paper in the documentation in that it includes the possibility of
providing a projection matrix which projects the *underlying* values
on the data, i.e., as in Eq. (3) of the paper. However, if this
projection matrix does not have full rank (eg, when the data is
incomplete), then the calculation of the split and merge hierarchy
implemented here is not correct. Therefore, if you want to employ the
split and merge algorithm with incomplete data we suggest that you use
full rank projection matrices and put in very large errors for the
unobserved dimensions. This works. Some hints are given in the code on
what the correct implementation would be for projections matrices that
don't have full rank.

The code here is also more general than the algorithm in that one can
specify a weight for each data point with which its contribution to
the log-likelihood should be weighted. Use this option with care!

USAGE II: THROUGH THE SHARED OBJECT LIBRARY
-------------------------------------------

The C-code implementing the algorithm can be called from other
C-programs by using the shared object library. The main function for
this purpose is the 'proj_gauss_mixtures' function. This function
takes as its input the data, the initial conditions, and some
parameters describing the kind of solution one wants, and updates the
initial conditions to the result of the algorithm.

The inputs are as follows: 

a. The data: an array of structures of type
'datapoint'. Each 'datapoint' structure holds all of the information
pertaining to one datapoint: 
struct datapoint{
  gsl_vector *ww;
  gsl_matrix *SS;
  gsl_matrix *RR; }; The vector ww holds the actual measured data; the
matrix SS holds the uncertainty covariance matrix associated with this
data point, and the projection matrix RR projects from the space where
the model lives to the space of the data (this could be a rotation, or
just simply a unit matrix if the model and the observations are given
in the same coordinates). Once can set RR to a null pointer if no
projection is necessary, in which case you also need to provide the
bool noproj (see later). The data->SS matrix can be (di,1) dimensional
instead of (di,di) dimensional, when the uncertainty covariances are
diagonal. In this case, also set the diagerrs bool (see below). The
integer 'N' specifies the number of datapoints.

b. The model parameters, i.e., the initial conditions: The initial
conditions for the model parameters are given as an array of
structures of type 'gaussian', each member of this array holds the
parameters for one of the Gaussian components:
struct gaussian{
  double alpha;
  gsl_vector *mm;
  gsl_matrix *VV; }; here, alpha holds the amplitude of this component
in the mixture, the vector mm holds the mean of this Gaussian
component, and the matrix VV holds its covariance matrix.
The integer 'K' specifies the number of Gaussian components in the mixture.

c. fixamp, fixmean, fixcovar: arrays of bools specifying for each
Gaussian component whether its amplitude, mean, or covariance,
respectively, should be held fixed during the optmization.

d. avgloglikedata: this double holds the average log likelihood of the
data, returned after convergence.

e. tol and maxiter: if the difference between two subsequent average
log likelhihoods is smaller than tol the algorithm is considered to
have converged. maxiter specifies the maximum number of iterations
(for the initial convergence and each individual split and merge step)
that the algorithm will go through before giving up.

f. likeonly: set this to true if you only want to calculate the
average log likelihood of the data given the model, without
optimization.

g. w, splitnmerge: w specifies the w parameter to be used in the
regularization (see the accompanying paper for more on this);
splitnmerge specifies the number of steps to go down in the
split-and-merge hierarchy before given up (again, see the paper for
more on this).

h. keeplog, logfile, convlogfile: set keeplog to true to print
information to a logfile: this includes the initial conditions used,
the average log likelihood in every step, and, for the split-and-merge
part, which Gaussians are split and which are merged and whether the
split-and-merge step was successfull or not. convlogfile holds only
the average loglikelihoods of the initial convergence (before the
first split-and-merge step) and those of successfull split-and-merge
steps.

i. noproj: indicates that no projection from the model space to the
data space is necessary.

j. diagerrs: indicates that the uncertainty covariances in data->SS
are diagonal, such that data->SS is a (di,1) matrix instead of a
(di,di) matrix.


USAGE III: THROUGH THE MAIN PROGRAM
-----------------------------------

AS OF v1.2, THE MAIN PROGRAM IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED

(deprecated) The "main" program: since no effort was made to develop
this, this "main" program is very rudimemtary. The input data and
initial conditions must be supplied in the files "inputdata.dat" and
"IC.dat" respectively, and the results are written to the file
"result.dat". The main advantage of the "main" program is that it can
deal with data that has unobserved dimensions that are different for
different data points, i.e., it can handle the situation in which the
first data point has one unobserved dimension and the second data
point has two unobserved dimension, etc. This is all rather irrelevant
given that unobserved dimension == large errors, but it could be
useful. The main disadvantage of the main program is that it has not
been tested extensively, but if it succeeds in getting the data and
the initial conditions to the main algorithm, the results should be
trusted (since the main algorith has been tested extensively).

The structure of the initial conditions file is as follows (see
examples/IC.dat for an example): First various parameters of the model
and the algorithm must be set, e.g., the number of Gaussians, the
maximum number of iterations, etc. Then the initial values for the
parameters of the various Gaussians must be set, first the amplitude,
then the components of the mean, and the covariance matrix (in the
format xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz, and similar for higher/lower
dimensions); see the file examples/IC.dat for a specific example of
this.

The structure of the data file is as follows (see
examples/inputdata.dat for an example of this): Each line holds the
data from one datapoint; separated by '|' first we specify the value
of the data point w, then the covariance matrix S associated with this
measurement (specified as xx, yy, xy, and similar for higher
dimensions), followed by the projection matrix (in the format 11, 12,
21, 22, and similar for higher dimensions).


USAGE IV: THROUGH R
-------------------

After installing the R package, open up an R console and type

> library(ExtremeDeconvolution)
> ?extreme_deconvolution

To see input arguments and an example.


OUTSTANDING ISSUES
------------------

For small data sets the algorithm will very rarely decrease the
likelihood in a step (which it is proven not to). This is most likely
due to a small numerical instability in the way the average log
likelihoods are calculated. These rare decreases are very small, and
do not seem to affect the good overall behavior of the algorithm.
